JSONP-Module  (for experiments, demos, and prototypes)
============

A very bare bones javascript asynchronous module to implement JSONP for cross-origin GET requests (CORS).  
This has no dependencies except that you don't use a an awful browser.

This is not suitable for production code.
This was made with minimal testing. YMMV.  

Feel free to refactor and send pull requests.
